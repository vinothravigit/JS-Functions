# Anonymous & IIFE Functions in JavaScript

In JavaScript, anonymous functions and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) are commonly used for encapsulating logic, creating private scopes, and executing code immediately. Below, we'll discuss their usage along with examples and various operations.

## Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions, also known as function expressions, are functions that are defined without a name. They are often used as arguments to other functions, assigned to variables, or used in other expressions.

### Usage:
- Callback functions
- Event handlers
- Iterating functions like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, etc.

## IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

IIFE is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is executed immediately after being created and has its own private scope, preventing variable collisions.

### Usage:
- Creating private scopes
- Initializing modules
- Preventing pollution of the global namespace

## Operations with Anonymous & IIFE Functions:

### 1. Print Odd Numbers in an Array
- An anonymous function or IIFE can iterate through an array and print odd numbers.

### 2. Convert All Strings to Title Caps in a String Array
- An anonymous function or IIFE can iterate through an array of strings and convert each string to title case.

### 3. Sum of All Numbers in an Array
- An anonymous function or IIFE can calculate the sum of all numbers in an array.

### 4. Return All Prime Numbers in an Array
- An anonymous function or IIFE can filter an array to return only prime numbers.

### 5. Return All Palindromes in an Array
- An anonymous function or IIFE can filter an array to return only palindrome strings.

### 6. Return Median of Two Sorted Arrays of the Same Size
- An anonymous function or IIFE can find the median of two sorted arrays.

### 7. Remove Duplicates from an Array
- An anonymous function or IIFE can remove duplicates from an array.

### 8. Rotate an Array by k Times
- An anonymous function or IIFE can rotate an array by a specified number of times.

These operations demonstrate the versatility and usefulness of anonymous functions and IIFE in JavaScript programming. They allow for cleaner, more concise code and provide better control over variable scope and execution flow.
